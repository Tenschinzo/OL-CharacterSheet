            generalDescription: "You create a being of subhuman intelligence that persists indefinitely and autonomously. It might be a living creature, an undead fiend, a sentient construct, or any similar creation possessing lifelike properties. Examples of this boon in play include a necromancer creating an undead bodyguard, a mad scientist forging a subhuman being from body parts collected from a variety of corpses, and an engineer creating a cyborg from parts collected at a scrap yard.",
            effectDescription: "You are able to create an autonomous being from inanimate material components, such as dirt, bones, water, vines, scrap metal, or sand (the materials used are subject to the GM's discretion). To do so, you must first spend 8 hours completing a ritual, experiment, or similar manufacturing process. After this process is complete, make an action roll to invoke this boon. If successful, the inanimate form is permanently imbued with sentience. Your ability to animate a creature does not grant you the permanent ability to control it. However, newly animated beings are affected by the charmed bane (see below), and thus treat you more favorably immediately following their creation. The GM, not the player, is responsible for deciding the attributes and abilities of this animated creature and should follow the guidelines established by the 'Simple Build' section for creating NPCs in Chapter 8: Running the Game. Creatures created using this boon are typically limited to those of subhuman intelligence, such as zombies, combat droids, and golems.",

Choose a single bane or boon which uses the same attribute that you used to invoke Aura. The maximum power level for the chosen bane or boon is one-half the power level of your aura. Your aura radiates the chosen bane or boon as follows:<br><b>If the aura radiates a bane,</b> then the target of the aura is not affected by it. All other creatures (friend or foe) who willingly enter the area of the aura or end their turn within it suffer a bane attack to inflict the chosen bane. No creature may be subject to a bane attack from the same creature's aura more than once per round.<br><b>If the aura radiates a boon,</b> then the target of the aura is also affected by it. The target and all allies who end their turn within the area of the aura automatically gain the chosen boon. Upon leaving the area of the aura, the boon is immediately removed.

            generalDescription: "You summon forth a wall of thorns, ring of fire, swarm of robotic pests, cloud of entropic fog, or similar barrier to hurt or hinder your foes.",

Upon successful invocation, choose a number of available properties for your wall based on your power level.<br><b>Damaging:</b> A creature who ends its turn within the barrier or willingly enters it, automatically suffers the indicated damage.

If you place an impassable barrier in a space occupied by a creature, move that creature to the closest position of their choice that is not inside of the barrier. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.<br><b>Baneful:</b> Choose a bane which you can inflict that has a power level less than or equal to the power level of your barrier. When a creature ends its turn within the barrier or willingly enters it, you may immediately make a bane attack against it to inflict the chosen bane. A creature can only be subject to one such bane attack from this barrier per round.<br><b>Mobile:</b> You may spend a major action to move the barrier up to 30 feet.",

Likewise, the target’s Guard defense is increased against enemies that can not detect them, though is unchanged against area attacks.<br>You cannot be the target of opportunity attacks unless the enemy is somehow aware of your location through another sensory element, applicable attribute roll, or other effect that allows them to locate you.

The effect cancels the effect of all natural light within its radius of effect and creatures that depend on light for vision suffer as though they have the blinded bane while in the area of effect. Creatures that do not depend on light for their vision (if they have tremorsense, blindsight, etc.) are unaffected. If the darkness area overlaps an area affected by the light boon, then the one of greater power level supersedes the other. If the power level of both is equal, then they cancel each other out.",

For undead, the aura is constant, since the power of death and magic is what animates them.</li><li><b>Magic</b> - Extraordinary auras surround objects or places imbued with such effects.

For example, Vera has a max HP of 20 but is turned into a dragon and her Fortitude increases from 5 to 9, increasing her hit points to 28. During combat, she suffers 10 damage. When she later transforms back into her human form, the 10 damage remains and is subtracted from her new maximum, leaving her with 10 out of 20 hit points.

The next attack made with the augmented item triggers that bane if your roll is equal to or above the target's defense score. Examples of the augmenting property include poison, special ammo cartridges, and magical jewels that can be attuned to a weapon to enhance its power. All augmenting items must have the expendable property.",

If an item has multiple area sizes, the attacker chooses from them with each attack. Attack and action rolls do not incur any of the disadvantage penalties usually associated with multi-targeting.",

This autonomy could be magical guidance, algorithmic targeting via a guidance system, or even mundane autonomy, such as pressure plates surrounded by murder holes (arrow slits with self-reloading crossbows).",

If the duration of a boon is instantaneous, the item automatically invokes the boon each round at the start of the wielder's turn. The wielder does not have to invoke this effect.

If both weapons you are wielding have passive benefits such as the defensive property, use the best of the two benefits; they are not added together.",

Also, they are specially built for distance and cannot be used to attack a target closer than 50'.",

Additionally, you gain a +1 armor bonus when wielding a defensive weapon (regardless of the defensive value listed). While wielding an item with the defensive property, you don't gain the advantage 1 to attacks normally associated with Melee One-handed or Two-handed weapons. A weapon cannot have a defensive value greater than 3.",
